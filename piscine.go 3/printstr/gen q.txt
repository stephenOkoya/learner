Question: PrintStr
Objective:
Write a function PrintStr that takes a string and prints it character by character, followed by a newline (\n), using only z01.PrintRune.

âœ… Function Signature:
go

func PrintStr(s string)
ðŸ§ª Example Usage:
Given the following code in main:

go

PrintStr("Hello World!")
The output should be:

nginx

Hello World!
ðŸ“Œ Requirements:
You must not use any package other than github.com/01-edu/z01.

You must print each character of the string individually using z01.PrintRune.

You must print a newline (\n) after the full string.

ðŸ§  Hints:
Use a for loop to iterate over the string:

go

for _, char := range s {
    z01.PrintRune(char)
}
Add a newline at the end with:

go

z01.PrintRune('\n')
