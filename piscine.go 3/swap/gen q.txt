 Question: Swap
Objective:
Write a function Swap that exchanges the values of two integers using pointers.

âœ… Function Signature:
go

func Swap(a *int, b *int)
ðŸ§ª Example Usage:
Given the following code in main:

go

a := 0
b := 1
Swap(&a, &b)
fmt.Println(a)
fmt.Println(b)
The output should be:

1
0
ðŸ“Œ Requirements:
You must use pointers to swap the values â€” no return values allowed.

The function should modify the original values of a and b by dereferencing the pointers.

You can use tuple assignment or a temporary variable.

ðŸ§  Hints:
With tuple assignment:

go

*a, *b = *b, *a
Or with a temporary variable:

go

temp := *a
*a = *b
*b = temp
