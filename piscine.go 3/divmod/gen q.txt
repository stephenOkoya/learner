Question: DivMod
Objective:
Write a function DivMod that computes the quotient and remainder of two integers and stores the results using pointers.

âœ… Function Signature:
go

func DivMod(a int, b int, div *int, mod *int)
ðŸ§ª Example Usage:
Given the following code in main:

go

a := 13
b := 2
var div int
var mod int
DivMod(a, b, &div, &mod)
fmt.Println(div)
fmt.Println(mod)
The output should be:

6
1
ðŸ“Œ Requirements:
The function should calculate:

The quotient of a divided by b and store it at *div.

The remainder of a divided by b and store it at *mod.

Do not return any value â€” only modify the values through the provided pointers.

ðŸ§  Hints:
Use Goâ€™s division (/) and modulus (%) operators.

Assign values through pointers:

go

*div = a / b
*mod = a % b
