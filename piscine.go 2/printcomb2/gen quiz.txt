ðŸ§© Question: PrintComb2
Objective:
Write a function PrintComb2 that prints all unique combinations of two different two-digit numbers in ascending order.

Each number pair must meet the following conditions:

The first number must be less than the second.

The output must be in the format: 00 01, 00 02, ..., 98 99

Each combination is separated by a comma and a space.

The last combination (98 99) should not be followed by a comma.

A newline (\n) should be printed at the end.

ðŸ§ª Expected Output:

00 01, 00 02, 00 03, ..., 98 99

 Constraints:
You must use runes only ('0' to '9') and z01.PrintRune.

Casting is allowed only for arithmetic, not for string formatting.

You must not use any packages except github.com/01-edu/z01.

You are not allowed to use string formatting (fmt.Printf, etc.).
