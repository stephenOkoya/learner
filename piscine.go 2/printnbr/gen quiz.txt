ðŸ§© Question: PrintNbr
Objective:
Write a function PrintNbr(n int) that prints an integer number (n) using only runes and the z01.PrintRune function.

This function should:

Print positive and negative integers correctly.

Handle 0 as a special case and print it properly.

Always print a minus sign (-) before negative numbers.

Print the number digit by digit without using any type casting for string conversion.

After all numbers are printed, a newline (\n) should be printed.

ðŸ§ª Expected Output:

-1230123
(Note: This is from PrintNbr(-123), PrintNbr(0), and PrintNbr(123) called in main())

Constraints:
You must not use fmt.Print, strconv, or string casting like string(n).

You must only use runes and z01.PrintRune to build the output.

You are allowed to use helper functions (like PrintPositiveNum) to split and print each digit.

You may use integer math (e.g., n / 10, n % 10) and arithmetic on runes (e.g., starting from '0' and incrementing it).

The function must work for all integers, including negatives and zero.

 Function Signature:
